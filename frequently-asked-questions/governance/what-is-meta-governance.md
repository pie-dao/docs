# What is Meta-Governance?

Pie Smart Pools like DEFI+S contains, among others, governance tokens of other protocols. For this reason, DOUGH holders will be in control of different tokens which can be used to govern DeFi protocols. By voting with DOUGH, PieDAOâ€™s members decide how those tokens should vote in the specific DAO.
