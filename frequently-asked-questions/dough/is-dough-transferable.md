# Is DOUGH transferable?

Yes. While DOUGHv1 was non transferable, the current version DOUGHv2, is transferable.

If you have acquired your DOUGH on the open market, such as on Balancer/Uniswap, or earned it through staking incentives, then you have DOUGHv2.

You can convert your DOUGHv1 to DOUGHv2 at a 1:1 ratio, otherwise, you can obtain DOUGHv2 by providing liquidity to Pies or acquiring it from the open market.
