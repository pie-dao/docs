# Are DOUGH token holders migrating to DOUGHv2 subject to vesting?

Yes, to align incentives early token requests were accepted at a lower rate than later ones but are subject to longer vesting periods. DOUGH holders are subject to the following vesting schedules:
- Contribution on Epoch 1 (from block to block) 1.5y vesting
- Contribution on Epoch 2 (from block to block) 1y vesting
- Summoners 3y vesting
- Bounties, no vesting applied
The vesting windows start at the moment the DOUGH v1 tokens were minted for your address according to *PIP 12 vesting schedule*.
