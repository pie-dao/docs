# What is DOUGH used for?

DOUGH is the governance token with value accrual from Pies fees.
- Govern Pies Parameters.
- Meta-governance for those tokens with governance capabilities inside the Pies.
- Value capture via fees redemption of the different pies (currently 0.7% streaming fee enabled on some pools.).
- Staking and delegation.

- Coming soon: *meta governance*
