# How are Pies Built?

Pies are created using Balancer. Each Pie is a Balancer pool, an Automated Market Maker containing multiple tokens of differing weights.

When users join a Pie they add liquidity to the pool, receiving an amount of the Pie's Balancer Pool Token proportional to their percentage of the total liquidity provided. Although Balancer currently only allows eight tokens per pool, our Pies are composable. As an example, the DeFi+S and DeFi+L Pies are combined to form DeFi++, a Pie containing thirteen DeFi tokens.
