# What is Pie Smart Pool?

Pie Smart Pools are non-custodial smart contracts, the first implementation of a DAO-governed AMM pool. They add extra functionality on top of vanilla AMMs pools.

Providing liquidity to one of these Pies gets you tokenized exposure to the underlying assets and additionally generates yield from the liquidity in these pools to perform token swaps The Pie Smart Pools are asset management agnostic.
