# What is the difference between minting a PIE vs buying it.

Buying purchases the Pie on the open Market at the market rate, where the token you received has already been minted. Minting creates a new token which has not existed before by providing the underlying assets.

DAI provides a good example. DAI is pegged to the price it can be redeemed for ($1). But DAI often is sold on the market for $1.01 demonstrating that the market rate and the native rate can differ.

The best route of acquisition for a PIE is largely dependent on current market forces, where Minting you know you are always getting equal value to what those tokens can be redeemed for. Gas for minting is higher than gas for buying, so factors like the size of an order should be taken into consideration, where the smaller the purchase the larger gas price has impact.
