# What is Governance?

Governance is a process through which a group of stakeholders decides on changes within their system or organization. Many centralized entities have expedited the governance process through the nomination of critical decision-makers like board members and executives. In the context of Pie DAO, anyone who owns and has staked DOUGH may vote on any decision, including, but not limited to, changes to the Asset Allocation within the products offered by Pie DAO, token sales to new members, and critical upgrades to the network.
