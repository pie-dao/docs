# What is a DAO?

DAO stands for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization," a smart contract system that functions through a governance structure embedded into the code of the system. These organizations consist of token holders who have the sole authority to enact changes. A DAO is decentralized because no single party can have control. It's autonomous in the sense that, once deployed, the organization governs itself through its built-in governance structure.
