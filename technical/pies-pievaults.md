# Pies \(PieVaults\)

### Description

PieVaults are on the Diamond standard, this standard ensures contracts can grow beyond their restricted size. \([extra info](https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-s-maximum-contract-size-limit-is-solved-with-the-diamond-standard-2189)\)

### Call Managers

CallManagers are addresses which are whitelisted to trigger arbitrary calls from the ExperiPie. A whitelisted caller can be added by calling `addCaller(_newCaller)` on the ExperiPie from the contract owner. ⚠️ This should be used with caution as it allows any token within an ExperiPie to be pulled out ⚠️. Only trusted addresses or smart contracts should be added as callers.

#### Lending Manager

The `lendingManager` allows the owner of that instance to withdraw and deposit tokens into lending lending protocols which are whitelisted in the `lendingRegistry`. The owner of the `lendingManager` instance can move tokens between whitelisted lending protocols in the `lendingRegistry`.

For a lending manager to be able to manage a ExperiPie's tokens it needs to be whitelisted as a caller.

The owner of the lending manager instance can `lend`, `unlend` and `bounce`\(hopping between protocols\).

These functions have the following interface and should be called on the Lending Manager contract.

```text
/**
    @notice Move underlying to a lending protocol
    @param _underlying Address of the underlying token
    @param _amount Amount of underlying to lend
    @param _protocol Bytes32 protocol key to lend to
*/
function lend(address _underlying, uint256 _amount) bytes32 _protocol) public;

/**
    @notice Unlend wrapped token from its lending protocol
    @param _wrapped Address of the wrapped token
    @param _amount Amount of the wrapped token to unlend
*/
function unlend(address _wrapped, uint256 _amount) public;

/**
    @notice Unlend and immediately lend in a different protocol
    @param _wrapped Address of the wrapped token to bounce to another protocol
    @param _amount Amount of the wrapped token to bounce to the other protocol
    @param _toProtocol Protocol to deposit bounced tokens in
*/
function bounce(address _wrapped, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _toProtocol) external;
```

### Lending Registry

The lending registry keeps track of all lending protocols and wrapped tokens. Only tokens and protocols registered in this registry can be used by the `LendingManager`. Currently supported lending protocols are Compound and Aave.

Contract address: `0xB739Dcf499306B191D9D4fa5255A8f20066a6a96`

With the following functions protocols and wrapped tokens can be added:

```text
/**
    @notice Set which protocl a wrapped token belongs to
    @param _wrapped Address of the wrapped token
    @param _protocol Bytes32 key of the protocol
*/
function setWrappedToProtocol(address _wrapped, bytes32 _protocol) external;

/**
    @notice Set what is the underlying for a wrapped token
    @param _wrapped Address of the wrapped token
    @param _underlying Address of the underlying token
*/
function setWrappedToUnderlying(address _wrapped, address _underlying) external;

/**
    @notice Set the logic contract for the protocol
    @param _protocol Bytes32 key of the procol
    @param _logic Address of the lending logic contract for that protocol
*/
function setProtocolToLogic(bytes32 _protocol, address _logic) external;

/**
    @notice Set the wrapped token for the underlying deposited in this protocol
    @param _underlying Address of the unerlying token
    @param _protocol Bytes32 key of the protocol
    @param _wrapped Address of the wrapped token
*/
function setUnderlyingToProtocolWrapped(address _underlying, bytes32 _protocol, address _wrapped) external;
```

Lending logic contracts return the calls needed to lend or unlend from a protocol.

### Deploying the factory

`npx buidler deploy-pie-factory --network mainnet`

### Deploying a PieVault

1. Create an allocation file like [this one](https://github.com/pie-dao/ExperiPie/blob/master/allocations/mainnet/DLY.json)
2. run `npx buidler deploy-pie-from-factory --allocation [PATH_TO_ALLOCATION] --factory [FACTORY_ADDRESS] --network mainnet`
3. Copy the tx hash and search on Etherscan to find the address
4. Verify the contract: `npx buidler verify [PIE_ADDRESS] --constructor-args ./verify/experiPie.js` --network mainnet
