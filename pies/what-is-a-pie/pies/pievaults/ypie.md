Yearn Finance Ecosystem Pie provides complete exposure to the growing Yearn network. YPIE is a PieVault, unlocking extra capabilities and active strategies.

Metagovernance, staking, lending, and interest-bearing assets are enabled by default and operate in the background without requiring any extra work from the pie holder. These revenue streams continually cause YPIE tokens to appreciate in value, redeemable for a greater share of underlying assets over time.\
