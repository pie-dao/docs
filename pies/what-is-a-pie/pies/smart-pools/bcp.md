### Description

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/bcp_stack_now_farms.png)

  
  
Balanced Crypto Pie is all you need, it provides complete exposure to what our community believes are the core must-own assets in cryptocurrency, an even 33.33% distribution between $BTC, $ETH and DEFI.  
  
The underlying assets in BCP are constantly taking profits and growing your holdings as it automatically rebalances to maintain the set allocation.
