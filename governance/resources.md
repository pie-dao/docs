# Initiatives

**DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.**

DAOs are an emerging segment of the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) revolution, with many communities now tackling a wide range of issues through collaborative action.

Nobody is in charge of PieDAO, everything happens through the consensus of DOUGH voters. \

Anybody can propose a new pie or an update to an existing one, and contribute to the ongoing discussions in either our Discord channel or forum.
