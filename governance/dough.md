# DOUGH

### **DOUGH**

DOUGH is the DAO’s governance token and the engine behind the PieDAO wealth creation machine. All protocol management decisions are made by the DOUGH holders: from new products to asset rebalancing, strategies, and integrations. Think of a bank where every customer has the right to be a board member. 

DOUGH enables its holders to take control of their financial future.

### Buybacks

Following PIP-19 all BAL generated by the DAO’s products are used to purchase DOUGH off the open market, to be used for future incentives programs or as otherwise determined through the governance process. So far over $500k of DOUGH has been bought back.

### Meta-governance

DOUGH isn’t just about PieDAO.  
It’s a governance passport for the entire DeFi ecosystem. DOUGH lowers the barrier to wider governance participation in unprecedented ways.  
Any asset with governance power held in a PieVault will be automatically delegated to PieDAO, enabling DOUGH holders to vote in that protocol’s governance decisions.  
**One DOUGH to govern them all.**
