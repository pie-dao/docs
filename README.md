The DAO's first line of products are [Balancer Smart Pools](technical/untitled.md), constant weight index funds, [PieVaults](technical/pies-pievaults.md), yield-generating tokenized portfolio allocations with productive assets, and The [Oven](pies/oven.md), a system that allows users to save gas on expensive transactions by batching them together.
